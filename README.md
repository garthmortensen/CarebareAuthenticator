# CarebareAuthenticator

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/carebareauthenticator/badge/?version=latest)](https://carebareauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

In this version, I've added a simple explanation of Kerberos, principal, and the role of the `kinit` . This additional documentation should make the code more understandable for someone unfamiliar with Kerberos.

I've also added readthedocs support!
